# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). TinyApp comes with login and registration functionality. It has access constraints depending on the user authentication. Cookies are secured through Cookie Session and passwords are hashed through b.crypt.
